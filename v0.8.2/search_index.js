From the SQLite documentation:\nUsually, though, it is not useful to evaluate exactly the same SQL statement more than once. More often, one wants to evaluate similar statements. For example, you might want to evaluate an INSERT statement multiple times though with different values to insert. To accommodate this kind of flexibility, SQLite allows SQL statements to contain parameters which are \"bound\" to values prior to being evaluated. These values can later be changed and the same prepared statement can be evaluated a second time using the new values.\nIn SQLite, wherever it is valid to include a string literal, one can use a parameter in one of the following forms:\n??NNN:AAAAAA@AAA\nIn the examples above, NNN is an integer value and AAA is an identifier. A parameter initially has a value of NULL. Prior to calling sqlite3step() for the first time or immediately after sqlite3reset(), the application can invoke one of the sqlite3bind() interfaces to attach values to the parameters. Each call to sqlite3bind() overrides prior bindings on the same parameter.","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"SQLite.execute!(stmt::SQLite.Stmt)\nSQLite.execute!(db::SQLite.DB, sql::String)","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Used to execute a prepared SQLite.Stmt.
